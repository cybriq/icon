The Independent Contractor Order Negotioation Protocol (ICON) for assisting the organisation of work documentation for independent contractors

## About

In order to assist in the focusing of work process and improve auditability while engaging in contract production, ICON is a set of guidelines and software tools for helping Contractors perform work better without sacrificing autonomy to managers.

- logging and automatically tagging messages relevant to work with use of short text tags and chat platform threading
- integrating issues tracking boards and automating attaching relevant data from message logs.
- defining stages of an order and ensuring the protocol is followed in educational materials as well as other possible methods of reminders and prompts.

By lowering the cost of organising the labor of contractors, the idea is to reduce the amount of management labor and make independent contractors more competitive with employees. There is also philosophy around greater independence of action leading to greater accountability and more measured and effective risk taking.
